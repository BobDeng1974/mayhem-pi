##Description
A raspberry pi port of the Game [Mayhem](http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2972) originally released as Public Domain / Shareware of the Amiga.

It was ported to the PC in 2002 by [devpack](https://github.com/devpack) and open sourced in 2011 [github.com/devpack/mayhem].(https://github.com/devpack/mayhem).

I picked up it up and ported it to the Raspberry Pi.
